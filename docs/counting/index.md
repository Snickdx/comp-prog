# Counting, Frequency, and Precomputation

This category covers techniques for efficiently counting elements, managing frequencies, and preprocessing data to enable faster queries. These methods are fundamental to many algorithmic solutions and are often used as building blocks for more complex algorithms.

## Techniques in This Category

| Technique | Description | Link |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Frequency Counting Arrays** | Using arrays to count occurrences of elements, enabling O(1) lookups for frequency queries. | [Frequency Arrays](frequency-arrays.md) |
| **Prefix / Difference Arrays** | Precomputing prefix sums or differences to answer range queries in constant time. | [Prefix Arrays](prefix-arrays.md) |
| **Sieve of Eratosthenes** | An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit through systematic elimination. | [Sieve of Eratosthenes](sieve-eratosthenes.md) |

## When to Use

These techniques are essential when:
- You need to answer multiple queries about ranges or frequencies
- Working with statistical data or counting problems
- Optimizing repeated computations
- Building foundations for more complex algorithms

## Key Benefits

- **Time Complexity**: Often reduces query time from O(n) to O(1)
- **Space Efficiency**: Uses simple data structures like arrays
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand
- **Versatility**: Applicable to a wide range of problems
