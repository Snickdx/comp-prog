# Graph & Network Modeling

Graph and network modeling techniques are essential for solving problems involving relationships, connections, and hierarchical structures. These algorithms form the foundation for many real-world applications including social networks, transportation systems, and computer networks.

## Techniques in This Category

| Technique | Description | Link |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **DFS / BFS** | Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search are fundamental graph traversal algorithms with different characteristics and use cases. | [DFS / BFS](dfs-bfs.md) |
| **Dijkstra / Bellman-Ford** | Shortest path algorithms for finding optimal routes in weighted graphs, each suitable for different graph types and constraints. | [Dijkstra / Bellman-Ford](dijkstra-bellman-ford.md) |
| **Union-Find** | A data structure and algorithm for efficiently managing disjoint sets, commonly used for connectivity problems and minimum spanning trees. | [Union-Find](union-find.md) |

## When to Use Graph Algorithms

Graph techniques are essential when:
- Data has inherent relationships or connections
- You need to find paths, cycles, or connectivity
- Working with hierarchical or network structures
- Solving optimization problems on connected components

## Common Graph Problems

- **Shortest Path**: Finding the minimum cost path between nodes
- **Connectivity**: Determining if nodes are reachable from each other
- **Cycle Detection**: Identifying cycles in directed or undirected graphs
- **Topological Sorting**: Ordering nodes based on dependencies
- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Finding the minimum cost tree connecting all nodes
