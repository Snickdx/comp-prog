# Simulation & Modeling

Simulation and modeling techniques involve creating computational models to represent real-world scenarios or abstract problems. These methods are particularly useful for problems that require systematic exploration of solution spaces or optimization with specific constraints.

## Techniques in This Category

| Technique | Description | Link |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Two Pointer / Sliding Window** | Efficient techniques for maintaining a dynamic range or window while processing data, commonly used for subarray problems. | [Two Pointer / Sliding Window](two-pointer-sliding-window.md) |
| **Binary Search on Answer** | An optimization technique that searches for the optimal parameter value using binary search, particularly useful when the problem has monotonic properties. | [Binary Search on Answer](binary-search-answer.md) |
| **Greedy Algorithms** | Algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step, often leading to globally optimal solutions for certain types of problems. | [Greedy Algorithms](greedy-algorithms.md) |

## When to Use Simulation & Modeling

These techniques are effective when:
- You need to explore a range of possible solutions
- The problem has monotonic or predictable properties
- Local optimization can lead to global optimization
- Working with constrained optimization problems

## Common Problem Types

### Sliding Window Problems
- **Maximum/Minimum Subarray**: Finding optimal subarrays of fixed or variable size
- **String Matching**: Finding patterns or anagrams in strings
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimizing resource usage within constraints

### Binary Search Applications
- **Parameter Optimization**: Finding optimal values for problem parameters
- **Feasibility Testing**: Determining if a solution exists for given constraints
- **Range Queries**: Finding values within specific ranges

### Greedy Applications
- **Scheduling**: Optimizing task or resource scheduling
- **Coin Change**: Finding minimum number of coins for change
- **Huffman Coding**: Optimal data compression
- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Finding optimal tree structures
